Oceans make up over 70% of the worlds surface. They are vital to all life on the planet as a large majority of the oxygen on the planet come from small ocean plants known as phytoplankton that live near the surface of the water. This is just one of the many reasons that it is important to look after our oceans. 

It is estimated that over 10 million tonnes of litter end up in the ocean each year. It is estimated that by 2050 the amount of plastic in the ocean will outnumber the fish(https://www.condorferries.co.uk/marine-ocean-pollution-statistics-facts). Although only 15% of the litter in ocean is floating. This still leaves 1.5 million tonnes of litter being desposited onto the surfacce of the ocean annually. (https://www.rte.ie/learn/2020/0805/1157573-ocean-plastics/). That is the type of ocean litter that is being targeted by the On-water Rubbish Collection robot with Automatic sensing (O.R.C.A). The project was stimulated by the increasing amount of litter in the oceans and the environment the author grew up in. 

Sevaral solutions to this problem have been created. However, the O.R.C.A based solution aims at a novel application that has previously been left unexplored.
