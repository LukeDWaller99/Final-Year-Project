The project has had a development lifecycle of approximately 36 weeks and began on the 6^th September 2021. 

The project was split into three phases of development, phase one was research and development of the project and ideas. Phase two was developing prototypes and testing. The final phase, phase three, was finalising the design and build. 

The project was managed using the following software: 

\begin{itemize}

\item{LaTeX (TeXMaker), to write the documentation for the project.}
\item{GitHub, for version control across the whole project.}
\item{Microsoft Excel, to produce Gantt chart and to produce graphs.}
\item{Microsoft OneNote, to log progress and documentation of research and experimentation.}

\end{itemize}

The management style for this project followed a similar style used by Roke Manor Research Ltds. agile framework. This framework follows and agile approach to project development \cite{agile_development}, which is evident in the adaptability of the project as it has developed. 

The utilised style used to manage the project was extremely effective and when utilised with software packages above, all tasks were executed in an organised manner. For general awareness of time management and deadlines, a Gantt chart was utilised. This worked well for this type of project, a solo project undertaken with the supervision of one party, but would not have scaled well to a project with a larger group and organisational supervision. Due to this utilisation method, setbacks were minimised and able to be accounted for within the initial plan. Any unplanned setbacks were easy to coordinate within such a small working group. 

The milestones laid out in the project Gantt Chart for phases 1, 2, and 3 are listed below in Appendix \ref{app:phase_1}, Appendix \ref{app:phase_2}, and Appendix \ref{app:phase_3} respectively.
