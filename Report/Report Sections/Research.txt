The majority of the coursework for the project was conducted during Phase 1 (INSERT REFERENCE TO PHASE 1), with some continuation into Phase 2 (INSERT REFERENCE TO PHASE 2). The follow three concepts were critically evaluated to find their strengths and weaknesses. 

\subsection{Concept Designs - Mechanical Assembly}
\subsubsection{Concept 1 - Dragged Net Based System}
Concept 1 features a monohull craft that consists of a net that is dragged. The craft would drive through litter, collecting it with the net after it has driven past.

As this design was complex and required a more unstable monohull design, it was deemed to be the contingency plan and would only be further explored if all other concepts had been deemed impractical.

\subsubsection{Concept 2 - Submerged Basket System}
Concept 2 uses a catamaran style hull with a gap in the middle. This gap would be filled with a removable basket that sits under the surface of the water. The craft would drive over the top of surface litter collecting it in the basket.

\subsubsection{Concept 3 - Conveyor System with Elevated Basket}
Concept 3 focuses on a conveyor belt with a raised basket to hold the collected litter. This would be straddled across a catamaran style hull. The excess liquid run off would be filtered and drained back into the water. This would allow basic samples to be taken of the debris floating inside the water alongside the litter collection.

\subsection{Concept Designs - Controller and Receiver}
\subsubsection{Concept 1 - Off the Shelf Solution}
Controller and Receiver concept 1 was to use an off the shelf system for controlling the craft. This system would be reliable, functional, but it would be expensive and not allow for versatility of inputs and outputs that we would be required. 

The lack input/output versatility would inhibit the use of smart features on the craft. This does not address any newer technologies or concepts that would be suited to this style of custom RC craft. 

Therefore it was decided that this concept would be used for initial testing and as contingency plan, final deployment would be using concept, unless this proved to be impractical.

\subsubsection{Concept 2 - Custom RF Based Solution}

Concept 2 introduces "smart" features such as custom battery management circuity and litter collection basket capacity sensing. It allowed for a number of inputs and outputs on each system (up to the limit of the board used to control the systems). This would allow for a highly adaptable control system that could be easily adapted for another use-case. The main craft could be changed and the controller system would be easily reusable. Using a microcontroller based system add the ability to add and remove devices as the requirements of the craft change.

The downsides os the system are... Fiddly AF, Hard to GET RC working, Required Knowledge of Microcontrollers to utilise full functionality.

\end{figure} 

Despite the downsides, this concept has been decided to be the most adaptable and most suited to this application. It is the most complicated of the two concepts; requiring a broad knowledge of embedded systems and battery management technologies. Moreover, the added complexity of the implementation is outweighed by the added functionality and expandability of this system. It was deemed better to design a system that would properly function instead of trying to adapt the correctly available solutions that may not work correct for this purpose.
